Here is Dinosaur-Factory BackGround
we ues the java-jdk17 to coding this background
our tech-stack is SpringBoot,ElasticSearch,Mysql,web3j,okhttp,Thymeleaf,JPA,blackChain(private)+Granache and Our technology stack will continue to grow, but our temporary basic skeleton is like this ...
our goal is to make a Nft-trading-Market 

- abstract data structure
  - We express the relationship between elements by combining the egg node and the dinosaur parent node in the form of a linked list.
  - And abstract the relationship between the three to form the nodes of a tree
  - Overall we build an abstract binary tree
- some features
  - Parent hash value is empty (root node) And the type is egg , There is only one sub-hash, and the type of the sub-node must be a dinosaur type nodeHere is the structure Schematic diagram
  - The parent hash is empty and the type is dinosaur
  - The parent hash value is not empty (egg node) And the type is egg ,There is only one sub-hash, and the type of the sub-node must be a dinosaur type node
